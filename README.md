<p> Hi :wave: Coders!
    <br> This is a clone website design of {Shopify}. I designed entirely on <b>TailwindCSS</b> and CSS framework.

<ul>

`CSS Tailwind`

`css breakpoint prefix`

`tailwind/componants` 

`Customization of containers` 

`flex` 
      
    It's quick and easy way to create website design compared to traditional way.

This is a clone website.
<br> I almost replicated it like an original website, except for some CSS animations. This I designed using Tailwind CSS entirely. It's a learning curve on container customization, prefix breakpoints, and flex/grid usage. It is relatively easy compared to traditional CSS or bootstrap.

Stay peace :lotus_position:
